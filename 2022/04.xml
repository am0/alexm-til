      <desc>Re-Volt was one of those games that wasn't fantastic, but I would still happily play it for hours when I got home back in the early 2000s. It was removed after some code rights issues, however, "According to ≈Åukasz Kukawski, GOG ended up having to make its own custom version of the game based on the original files." GOG doing amazing work as always.</desc>
